\chapter*{Abstract}

The study proposes to develop a two-stage automated coffee bean sorter that identifies the good beans, less-dense beans and at the same time segregating the defective coffee bean using machine vision and density-based analysis. In the first stage, the defective beans will be detected through the use of machine vision, parameters such as size and defects are taken into account. The second stage is used to categorize each bean by its density, which is calculated by its mass and volume. Thus, beans with relatively low density and not within the size threshold, are sorted out. The system aims to incorporate machine vision and density analysis to reduce human labor and provide an alternative to manual sorting methods for the farmers and coffee bean producers.
