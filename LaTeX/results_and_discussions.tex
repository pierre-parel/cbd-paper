Show in this chapter proofs why your proposed solution works.  However, presenting results ("It worked") without an appropriate explanation does not show thorough understanding.  Aside from the data and results that you have obtained, and their explanation, the discussion includes why components of your proposed solution work did or did not work in accordance to what you described in the evaluation process, and how the proposed solution performed and faired. Interpret the results and the reasons why they were obtained.  If your results are incorrect, apparent discrepancies from theory should be pointed out and explained. In essence, what do the results mean?  Citing existing publication can help you compare your results and your explanations. 

The next items below is not related to the description of this results and discussions chapter, but serves as an opener for the \LaTeX portion of this template.

Here is an example of a citation for ISO~80000-2 standard~\cite{ISO800002}. Another one is~\cite{Einstein} and~\cite{croft-78}. 

In using this template, the user is expected to have a working knowledge of \LaTeX. A good introduction is in~\cite{Oetiker2014}.  Its latest version can be accessed at \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort}. See the Appendix of \verb|document_guide.pdf |for examples.


In aggregate form, Table~\ref{tab:outcomes_per_objective} shows the outcomes and completions in applying the methodology of the \documentType per objective.
