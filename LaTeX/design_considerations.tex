Before starting the first section, provide an overview of the purpose of this chapter and its contents, and how they are relevant to your methodology. 

Your primary goal in the Design Considerations chapter is to describe to your panelist/readers the key topics that fall further under Theoretical Considerations, but should be placed here instead since they are geared towards your Methodology. These key topics are those that you have directly adopted in making your solution/methodology.  You can think of the connection of the Design Considerations chapter to the Theoretical Considerations chapter in this way: if your Theoretical Considerations chapter serves as the main foundation of a building, then the Design Considerations chapter functions as the columns. 

The  Design Considerations chapter is an avenue for explaining why you considered the topics here for your proposed methodology. This chapter is different from your methodology, because topics you discuss here are already accepted as part of the body of knowledge, and may have not been developed by you.

\section{Standards}

Standards are essential for successful projects and impactful research. They provide a common framework and ensure consistency, quality, and safety across various disciplines. By adhering to established standards, your work becomes more reliable, interoperable, and valuable in real-world applications. Standards also demonstrate your understanding of industry best practices and enhance the credibility of your research.

To effectively integrate standards into your project, begin by identifying relevant standards related to your specific field. Thoroughly research and understand the requirements and guidelines outlined within these standards. Align your project objectives and methodologies to meet or exceed these standards. Document your use of standards \underline{in this section}, including how and why specific standards were chosen. Finally, evaluate your results against the established standards, justifying any deviations from the norm with sound reasoning and evidence.
