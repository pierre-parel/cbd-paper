With substantial growth in the global coffee market, ensuring the quality of coffee beans becomes imperative. Previous studies predominantly employ classification methods, with limited focus on object detection for identifying defects within a group of Arabica green coffee beans. We applied a different approach, employing DEtection TRansformer (DETR) to detect defective Arabica green coffee beans in an end-to-end fashion and performed a comparison with the state-of-the-art You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8). Our implementation of the DETR model exhibits proficiency in detecting defects beyond annotations without overlapping. On the other hand, YOLOv8 offers speed and a reduction in false positives. Our study emphasizes the significance of detecting defects in Arabica green coffee beans and introduces a novel approach to achieve this through DEtection TRansformer (DETR). By comparing it with the state-of-the-art You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8), we unveil these methodologies’ diverse strengths and contributions to defect detection, providing valuable insights for the coffee bean quality assurance process in the dynamic global market.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2024 10th International Conference on Computing and Artificial Intelligence}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Amadea, Vania and Rachmawati, Ema and Ferdian, Edward and Akbar, Muhammad Naufal Syawali}, year={2024}, month=aug, pages={103–110}, collection={ICCAI ’24} }}

Since the two problems are brought about by the complex mathematical operations being used by the algorithms, these were replaced by a discriminant. The developed discriminant, equivalent to the product of total difference and intensity divided by the normalization values, is based on the “pixel pair formation” that produces optimal peak signal to noise ratio. Results of the study applying the discriminant for the edge detection of green coffee beans shows improvement in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and execution time. It was determined that accuracy level varied according to the total difference of pixel values, intensity, and normalization values. Using the developed edge detection technique led to improvements in the PSNR of 2.091%, 1.16 %, and 2.47% over Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts respectively. Meanwhile, improvement in the MSE was measured to be 13.06%, 7.48 %, and 15.31% over the three algorithms.

However, the Thai coffee business must ensure consistent quality standards and is currently heavily dependent on manual labor, to first identify, and then remove substandard unroasted coffee beans. This research developed a classification model based on a Convolutional Neural Network to detect 17 types of defects in green coffee beans. The image augmentation phase was enhanced by rotating images at 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, and 270° and expanding the dataset from 979 original images across 17 defect types to a robust 6,853 images. Several architectures including MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, InceptionV2, and ResNetV2 were assessed. Following extensive evaluations, MobileNetV3 emerged as the best-performing model and underwent further fine-tuning, achieving significant accuracy improvements through hyperparameter optimization. The model’s robustness and generalizability were validated via 5-fold cross-validation, with accuracy ranging from 98.78 % to 99.84 % across all defect types. When tested with unseen data, the model achieved an accuracy of 88.63 %. A web application prototype was also developed for real-time coffee bean defect classification and its usability was tested. Seven farmers reported high satisfaction with the ease of use and effectiveness of the application in classifying coffee bean defects, with 71.4 % expressing a strong likelihood of recommending the application to others. These promising results demonstrate the practical utility of the model in enhancing quality sorting processes in the coffee industry.}, journal={Smart Agricultural Technology}, author={Arwatchananukul, Sujitra and Xu, Dan and Charoenkwan, Phasit and Aung Moon, Sai and Saengrayap, Rattapon}, year={2024}, month=dec, pages={100680} }}

To solve the problem, recent researches about integrating image processing techniques in industrialization has become more apparent apart from only a few that focus on the different features of a coffee bean. The focus of this paper is to create a device that can evaluate the size, quality, and roast level of a batch of the coffee bean through the use of image processing techniques and Back Propagation Neural Network. BPNN would serve as the brain of the device to determine these features. This study would use different image processing techniques such as K-mean shift, Blob, and Canny Edge to extract the features of the coffee beans and use Red Green Blue Analysis, Hu’s Moment, and Blob Analysis to make use of these features and feed it into the BPNN.

Deep learning techniques employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with numerous layers of non-linear processing for extracting the features automatically and classification that solves the previous problem. In the real time applications most of the time, either the dataset is unavailable or has less amount of data which makes it difficult to achieve accurate results for classifying the images. CNNs are hard to be trained using the small datasets. Transfer learning has emerged as a very powerful technique where in the knowledge gained from the larger dataset is transferred to the new dataset.

Cold brew was prepared by immersion and hot brew coffee by French Press. Total dissolved solids (TDS), titratable acidity (TA), caffeine, trigonelline, 4 and 5- caffeoylquinic acids were quantified by instrumental methods, volatile compounds by GC–MS, and the coffee flavor was through quantitative sensory evaluation. Coffee beverages were more differentiated by brewing method than by the coffee bean quality used in the preparation. Cold brew coffees were mainly associated with volatile 2-methyl-butanal, 5-methyl furfural, and dihydro-2-methyl- 3 (2H) -furanone. Hot brew coffee beverages were identified with some specific furans and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. No significant differences were found in TDS, caffeine, trigonelline, 4 and 5 caffeoylquinic acids. A higher TA was observed in hot coffee beverages than in cold brew coffees. Regular bean quality promoted undesirable sensory attributes in both cold and hot brew beverages. However, these attributes were perceived in higher intensity in hot brew coffee beverages.

Therefore, this paper presents an image processing and machine learning technique integrated with an Arduino Mega board, to evaluate those four important factors when selecting best-quality green coffee beans. For this purpose, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to determine the quality of coffee beans and their corresponding defect types.

Defect detection methods, however, often involve a great deal of time and manual work. Image processing has become widely used as a means of reducing the required detection time and effort in manufacturing. To this end, this study proposes an image-processing algorithm for detecting defects in images with striped backgrounds—defect types include scratches and stains. In order to detect defects, the proposed method first pre-processes images and rotates them to align the stripes horizontally. Then, the images are divided into two parts: blocks and intervals. For the blocks, a one-dimensional median filter is used to generate defect-free images, and the difference between the original images and the defect-free images is calculated to find defects. For the intervals, defects are identified using image binarization. Finally, the method superposes the results found in the blocks and intervals to obtain final images with all defects marked. This study evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm using 65 synthesized images and 20 actual images. The method achieved an accuracy of 97.2% based on the correctness of the defect locations. The defects that could not be identified were those whose greyscales were very close to those of the background.}, number={33}, journal={Applied Sciences}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Lee, Wei-Chen and Tai, Pei-Ling}, year={2020}, month=jan, pages={1012}, language={en} }}

In general, the CNN model was applied to defect inspection on the surface of raw materials or final products, and its accuracy also showed better performance compared to human inspection. However, surfaces with heterogeneous and complex backgrounds have difficulties in separating defects region from the background, which is a typical challenge in this field. In this study, the CNN model was applied to detect surface defects on a hierarchical patterned surface, one of the representative complex background surfaces. In order to optimize the CNN structure, the change in inspection performance was analyzed according to the number of layers and kernel size of the model using evaluation metrics. In addition, the change of the CNN’s decision criteria according to the change of the model structure was analyzed using a class activation map (CAM) technique, which can highlight the most important region recognized by the CNN in performing classification. As a result, we were able to accurately understand the classification manner of the CNN for the hierarchical pattern surface, and an accuracy of 93.7% was achieved using the optimized model.}, number={99}, journal={Materials}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Moon, In Yong and Lee, Ho Won and Kim, Se-Jong and Oh, Young-Seok and Jung, Jaimyun and Kang, Seong-Hoon}, year={2021}, month=jan, pages={2095}, language={en} }}

Each region of coffee bean production has its own quality, which will affect the price and flavor. Conducting the sorting process manually will cost a lot of time and probably inaccurate. Therefore, technology will be required to make the selection process faster. We conduct a study to measure the quality of arabica green coffee beans based on their defect level and further classify them into five grades: specialty grade, premium grade, exchange grade, below grade, and off grade, by using the computer vision approach. We use the color histogram and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to extract color and texture features of arabica green coffee beans. These feature extraction methods could well represent the quality of the beans. For the grade determination process, we compare the performance of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). From the experimental result, we successfully showed that the combination of color and texture visual feature and machine learning approach achieved promising results with an accuracy of 87.87% and 80.47%, by using Random Forest and KNN respectively.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communication and Information Processing}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={N.S.

This evaluation is normally carried out by visual inspection or using traditional instruments which have some limitations. Thus, the objective of this study was to construct a computer vision system that yields CIE (Commission Internationale d’Eclairage) L*a*b* measurements of green coffee beans and classifies them according to their color. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used as the transformation model and the Bayes classifier was used to classify the coffee beans into four groups: whitish, cane green, green, and bluish-green. The neural networks models achieved a generalization error of 1.15% and the Bayesian classifier was able to classify all samples into their expected classes (100% accuracy). Therefore, the proposed system is effective in classifying variations in the color of green coffee beans and can be used to help growers classify their beans.}, journal={Journal of Food Engineering}, author={de Oliveira, Emanuelle Morais and Leme, Dimas Samid and Barbosa, Bruno Henrique Groenner and Rodarte, Mirian Pereira and Pereira, Rosemary Gualberto Fonseca Alvarenga}, year={2016}, month=feb, pages={22–27} }}

Currently, coffee beans selection is carried out either manually, which is a costly and unreliable process, or using electronic sorting machines, which are often inefficient because some coffee beans defects, such as sour and immature beans, have similar spectral response patterns. In this sense, the present work aimed to assess coffee beans quality using both computer vision and machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Random Forest (RF). For this purpose, an algorithm written in Python language was developed to extract shape and color features from coffee beans images. The obtained dataset was then used as input to the machine learning algorithms. The data reported in this study pointed to the importance of color descriptors for classifying coffee beans defects. Among the variables used, the components from RGB (Red, Green and Blue) and HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color spaces presented the most relevant contribution for the classification models. Also, the results reported in this study provides evidence that computer vision along with machine learning algorithms can be used to identify and classify coffee beans with a very high accuracy (&gt; 90%).}

Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the effects of inclined angle and oscillating revolution speed on the performance of size grading machine of Robusta green coffee bean using oscillating sieve with swing along width direction. When increasing the inclined angle from 4 to 6 degree, the weight purity index and the clogging sieve percentage were decreased. For the size grading efficiency, it found that the size grading efficiency was increased when the inclined angle increased from 4 to 5 degree. However, the size grading efficiency was decreased when increasing the inclined angle from 5 to 6 degree. When considering in term of oscillating revolution speed, the increase of oscillating revolution speed provided the decrease of weight purity index, size grading efficiency and clogging sieve percentage. The appropriate condition for using the size grading machine of Robusta green coffee bean using oscillating sieve with swing along width direction is the inclined angle of 5 degree and the oscillating revolution speed of 185 rpm.}, number={1}, journal={IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Srisang, N and Chanpaka, W and Chungcharoen, T}, year={2019}, month=aug, pages={012037}, language={en} }}
