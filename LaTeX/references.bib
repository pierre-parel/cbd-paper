    the objective of this study was to construct a computer vision system that yields CIE (Commission Internationale d’Eclairage) L*a*b* measurements of green coffee beans and classifies them according to their color. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used as the transformation model and the Bayes classifier was used to classify the coffee beans into four groups: whitish, 
    cane green, 
    green, 
    and bluish-green. The neural networks models achieved a generalization error of 1.15% and the Bayesian classifier was able to classify all samples into their expected classes (100% accuracy). Therefore, 
    the proposed system is effective in classifying variations in the color of green coffee beans and can be used to help growers classify their beans.},

    abstractNote={A convolutional neural network (CNN), which exhibits excellent performance in solving image-based problem, has been widely applied to various industrial problems. In general, the CNN model was applied to defect inspection on the surface of raw materials or final products, and its accuracy also showed better performance compared to human inspection. However, surfaces with heterogeneous and complex backgrounds have difficulties in separating defects region from the background, which is a typical challenge in this field. In this study, the CNN model was applied to detect surface defects on a hierarchical patterned surface, one of the representative complex background surfaces. In order to optimize the CNN structure, the change in inspection performance was analyzed according to the number of layers and kernel size of the model using evaluation metrics. In addition, the change of the CNN’s decision criteria according to the change of the model structure was analyzed using a class activation map (CAM) technique, which can highlight the most important region recognized by the CNN in performing classification. As a result, we were able to accurately understand the classification manner of the CNN for the hierarchical pattern surface, and an accuracy of 93.7% was achieved using the optimized model.},

    abstractNote={In 2016 to 2017, the value of Asia’s coffee market has increased rapidly with an annual rate of 6% on average. Each region of coffee bean production has its own quality, which will affect the price and flavor. Conducting the sorting process manually will cost a lot of time and probably inaccurate. Therefore, technology will be required to make the selection process faster. We conduct a study to measure the quality of arabica green coffee beans based on their defect level and further classify them into five grades: specialty grade, premium grade, exchange grade, below grade, and off grade, by using the computer vision approach. We use the color histogram and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to extract color and texture features of arabica green coffee beans. These feature extraction methods could well represent the quality of the beans. For the grade determination process, we compare the performance of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). From the experimental result, we successfully showed that the combination of color and texture visual feature and machine learning approach achieved promising results with an accuracy of 87.87% and 80.47%, by using Random Forest and KNN respectively.},

    abstractNote={The increasing market interest in coffee beverage, 
    lead coffee growers around the world to adopt more efficient methods to select the best-quality coffee beans. Currently, 
    coffee beans selection is carried out either manually, 
    which is a costly and unreliable process, 
    or using electronic sorting machines, 
    which are often inefficient because some coffee beans defects, 
    such as sour and immature beans, 
    have similar spectral response patterns. In this sense, 
    the present work aimed to assess coffee beans quality using both computer vision and machine learning techniques, 
    such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
    Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Random Forest (RF). For this purpose, 
    an algorithm written in Python language was developed to extract shape and color features from coffee beans images. The obtained dataset was then used as input to the machine learning algorithms. The data reported in this study pointed to the importance of color descriptors for classifying coffee beans defects. Among the variables used, 
    the components from RGB (Red, 
    Green and Blue) and HSV (Hue, 
    Saturation and Value) color spaces presented the most relevant contribution for the classification models. Also, 
    the results reported in this study provides evidence that computer vision along with machine learning algorithms can be used to identify and classify coffee beans with a very high accuracy (&gt; 90%).

    abstractNote={Size grading is one of important processes for producing the Robusta green coffee bean because it can increase the value of green coffee bean and decrease the problem in the manufacturing process, 
    especially roasting process. Therefore, 
    the objective of this work was to investigate the effects of inclined angle and oscillating revolution speed on the performance of size grading machine of Robusta green coffee bean using oscillating sieve with swing along width direction. When increasing the inclined angle from 4 to 6 degree, 
    the weight purity index and the clogging sieve percentage were decreased. For the size grading efficiency, 
    it found that the size grading efficiency was increased when the inclined angle increased from 4 to 5 degree. However, 
    the size grading efficiency was decreased when increasing the inclined angle from 5 to 6 degree. When considering in term of oscillating revolution speed, 
    the increase of oscillating revolution speed provided the decrease of weight purity index, 
    size grading efficiency and clogging sieve percentage. The appropriate condition for using the size grading machine of Robusta green coffee bean using oscillating sieve with swing along width direction is the inclined angle of 5 degree and the oscillating revolution speed of 185 rpm.},
