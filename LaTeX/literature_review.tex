It is to be noted that each subsection in this chapter should discuss in narrative form each table that is presented in order to point out to the reader what the author(s) intend to convey.

\section{Existing Work}

Cite and summarize here relevant and significant literature (dissertations, theses, journals, patents, notable conference papers) through a table and descriptions to prove that no one has done your work yet and/or that your work is not a duplication of existing ones. Your focus here is what has \emph{been done}.

\section{Lacking in the Approaches}

You can summarize the weaknesses of existing approaches by a tabular comparison of the literature. Your focus here is what has \emph{not been done}, i.e. what features were missed, what solutions were not considered, what the demerits are, etc.  Through these items, you then can introduce the necessity for doing your proposed solution.  

It is to be noted that the degree of novelty for undergraduate thesis is lower than those for graduate school. If a Ph.D. dissertation/thesis has a high degree of novelty and that for an undergraduate is low, then a master's thesis is somewhere between the two.

Briefly include here the following in order to remind the reader why you are highlighting the weaknesses of the solutions of existing literature. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item mentioning the problem
	\item showing how your solution is better (can be better (for proposals))
\end{itemize}
