% \includeonly{} is for specifying which files to include; if you only want to work on one or few chapters, you can only include those chapters, which will speed up the document build; advantage: fast if you have a large number of images in your results chapter, which you do not need when you are working on other chapters; you can still reference all the figures in the omitted chapter, as long as you have previously LaTeX-built the entire document

% Note that the file names below must correspond to those names inside \include{} in the \begin{document} ... \end{doument} enviroment, otherwise the chapter will not be included

				\noindent Throughout this \MakeTextLowercase{\documentType}, mathematical notations conform to ISO~80000-2 standard, e.g., variable names are printed in italics, the only exception being acronyms like, e.g., $\mathrm{SNR}$, which are printed in regular font.  Constants are also set in regular font like $\mathrm{j}$.  Standard functions and operators are also set in regular font, e.g., in $\sin \left( \cdot \right)$, $\max \{ \cdot \} $.  Commonly used notations are $t$, $f$, $\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}$, $n$ and $\exp \left( \cdot \right)$, which refer to the time variable, frequency variable, imaginary unit, $n$th variable, and exponential function, respectively.
